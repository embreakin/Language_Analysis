# Automization and Analyzation Code for Language_Analysis
These are the code I use for my Google Sheet file called `Language_Analysis`.
I use it to keep track of the number of words I have learned thus far for all the languages I am learning.  
1. `Language_Analysis.js` is implemented in GAS, and it automatically acquires the necessary data every day and records it in the `Language_Analysis` Google Sheet file.  
1. `Language_Analysis.py` is expected to run on Google Colaboratory and can show the current number of words learned and the time evolution of the number of words learned for each language.
