# Language_Analysis
This is the code I use for my Google Sheet file called `Language_Analysis.`  
I use it to keep track of the number of words I have learned thus far for all the languages I am learning. The code is implemented in GAS, and it automatically acquires the necessary data every day and records it in the `Language_Analysis` file.
